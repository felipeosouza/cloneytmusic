# ytmusicclone
Clone of YTMusic's Home screen, the music app I use and find absolutely beautiful, which made me want to replicate it.
# Features used in this project
*react-native-animated* to animate the collapsable header, opacities and shining effects;  
*Spotify API from rapidapi* to get free song information;  
*fetch* to get the songs;  
*React Context* to wait for songs to fetch;
